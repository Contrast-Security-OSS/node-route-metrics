# Integration tests

`test-integration/` contains tests that exercise route-metrics in a server.

## Components of the tests

### checks/
`checks/` is a framework for checking log files generated by route-metrics when running the server tests.

### _helpers.js
`_helpers.js` generates all combinations of test parameters to assure 100% coverage.

### servers-*.test.js
`servers-*.test.js` are the integration tests for the servers. They verify that route-metrics works with all variations of servers.
